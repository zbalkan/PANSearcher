# PANSearcher
![Build](https://github.com/zbalkan/PANSearcher/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)

## Description

A command line application to search for PAN numbers in files. It is a hobby project and not ready for production use. The idea is to  PANHunt.

Although it is written from scratch, it is using directly (ripping off) some parts of PANHunt such as Regex patterns.

## Dependencies
- dotnet 6.0

## Installation
Currently it is portable. Just compile and run.
