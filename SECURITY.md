## Vulnerability Management Process (draft, reference [Github.blog](https://github.blog/2022-02-09-coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-cvd-open-source-projects/))
1. **Acknowledgment**: The maintainer(s) acknowledges the reporter in a week that the reported issue is acknowledged.
2. **Assessment**: The maintainer(s) assesses the reported issue. If they determine it is not a security threat, they may stop the disclosure process and ask you to submit it as a public non-security issue instead.
3. **Patch creation**: Once the vulnerability is confirmed, the project maintainers will begin developing a patch out of the public eye. At this step, they may reach out to you to help develop and test the patch.
4. **Common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) number request**: The project may request a CVE entry if the vulnerability is eligible for one.
5. **Public disclosure**: Once a patch is published, maintainers will notify users and direct them to update.
